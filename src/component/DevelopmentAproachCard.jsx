          SB Admin 2 makes extensive use of Bootstrap 5 utility classes in order
          to reduce CSS bloat and poor page performance. Custom CSS classes are
          used to create custom components and custom utility classes.

          Before working with this theme, you should become familiar with the
          Bootstrap framework, especially the utility classes.
